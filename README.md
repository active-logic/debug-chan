# Debug-Chan [WIP]

Fork of *active-logic/prolog*; mainly because I need to share chanelled logging while roadwork is happening.

## What's up with Prolog and Debug Chan

- *Prolog* is an aggressive instrumentation/debugger used to trace Unity games (based on mono.cecil). Prolog was created as an offshoot of the active-logic project (to help debug behavior trees); some interest recently and efforts to make this more usable.
- *Debug-Chan* is a channelled frame logger; makes it easy to view traces on a per game object basis, either for the current frame (play time) or history (while paused)

Right now: too many similarities between Prolog, Debug-Chan and the better established Active Logic frame logger; trying to unify front ends and put the loggers under the same banner.

More info will be provided later.

*Unrelated note* - Gabranth is one of the coolest characters in FFXII, just keep that in mind.
