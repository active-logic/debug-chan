NOTE: Fork of *active-logic/prolog*; mainly because I need to share chanelled logging while roadwork is happening.

# Debug-Chan

A handy logging tool for Unity game development:

- Channeled logging on a per game object basis
- Automated call tracing (optional)

Tired of pesky `Debug.Log`? Would prefer beautiful logs that let you see what the @#%^@^$ your game objects are doing without getting in the way?

Debug-Chan is for you.

## Get started with chaneled logging

## Get started with automated call tracing

*Unrelated note* - Gabranth is one of the coolest characters in FFXII, just keep that in mind.
